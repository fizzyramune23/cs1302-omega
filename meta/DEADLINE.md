## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

    My app allows users to search a specific Pokemon's stats and also provides information on all cards associated
with that Pokemon. Users are also able to exit the app using the exit button.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    I learned how to work with Apis that require an api key, and this project also furthered my understanding
of how to parse JSON Elements and Objects.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    If I could redo the project I would try to work on the aesthetic of the project. The app is very plain looking and makes it
kinda boring to use. I would also try and add card prices to the card information section.
